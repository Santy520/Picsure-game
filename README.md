# PicSure?
Location matching game. A random photo from one of 10 US cities is shown to user along with current weather status to provide context clues to allow user to guess the location.

# Description
The PicSure? application includes a navigation bar including a modal for game rules, and a timer. There is a welcome page with a form for the user to add their own username that will save their high scores. There is a play button, and two API's being called. One API calls a photo of a city while the other API calls weather data to give the user hints to the city being shown in the photo. There is a drop down with 10 city options that the user could choose from, as well as a score index that will increase when the user chooses the correct answer.
